# Streaming Data Integration of Senor Data into Timeseries DB

In this workshop we will be ingesting data from simulated IoT devices into InfluxDB, a popular timeseries database

## Running the IoT Simulator

Before we can run the Simulator, we have to configure the kind of data we want it to generate.

We can do that using a JSON configuration file. Create a new folder `conf` and create a `devices-def.json` file

```
mkdir conf

nano conf/devices-def.json
```

and add the following configuration

```
[
    {
        "type":"simple",
        "uuid":"",
        "topic":"device/{$uuid}",
        "sampling":{"type":"fixed", "interval":1000},
        "copy":10,
        "sensors":[
            {"type":"dev.timestamp",    "name":"ts", "format":"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ"},
            {"type":"dev.uuid",         "name":"uuid"},
            {"type":"double_walk",   "name":"temp",  "min":-15, "max":3},
            {"type":"double_cycle",  "name":"level", "values": [1.1,3.2,8.3,9.4]},
            {"type":"string",        "name":"level", "random": ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o"]}
        ]
    }
]
```

now let's run the IoT Simulator with this definition file. 

```
docker run -v $PWD/conf/devices-def.json:/conf/devices-def.json trivadis/iot-simulator -dt MQTT -u tcp://dataplatform:28100 -t iot/ -cf /conf/devices-def.json
```

The data is published to MQTT.  

For viewing the messages in MQTT, we need something similar to the `kafkacat` and `kafka-console-consumer` utilities. As demonstrated in a previous workshop, we can either consume from the command line using a dockerized MQTT client or we can use the browser-based [HiveMQ Web UI](https://www.hivemq.com/docs/3.4/web-ui/introduction.html) client. 

So either from a terminal run

```
docker run -it --rm efrecon/mqtt-client sub -h $DOCKER_HOST_IP -p 28100 -t "iot/device/#" -v
```

or navigate to <http://dataplatform:28082> and connect using `dataplatform` for the **Host** field, `28024` for the **Port** field and then click on **Connect**. Once connected, create a new subscription using the Topic pattern `iot/device/#`

![Alt Image Text](./images/mqttui-subscirbe.png "MQTT UI Connect")

and click **Subscribe** and you should see a viusalization of the messages generated by the simulator while they arrive.

Let's integrate these MQTT topics with Kafka using StreamSets Data Collector. 

## Integrate MQTT with Kafka using StreamSets

Navigate to <http://dataplatform:28029/> and create a new pipeline and name it `IoT_MQTT_to_Kafka`. On the Pipeline canvas, add a `MQTT Subscriber` origin and a `Kafka Producer` destination. 

![Alt Image Text](./images/streamsets-mqtt-to-kafka-1.png "MQTT UI Connect")

Configure the **MQTT Subscriber** using the following settings

* **Broker URL**: `tcp://mosquitto-1:1883`
* **Topic Filter**: `iot/device/#`
* **Data Format**: `JSON`

Configure the **Kafka Producer** using the following settings

* **Broker URI**: `kafka-1:9092`
* **Topic**: `iot-v1`
* **Data Format**: `JSON`

On Pipeline level set ** Error Records ** to `Discrd (Library: Basic)`. 

Before we can run the pipeline, we have to create the Kafka topic `iot-v1`, for example using the KafkaHQ service (<http://dataplatform:28042/>):

![Alt Image Text](./images/kafkahq-create-topic.png "MQTT UI Connect")

Now run the StreamSets Pipeline and check that data is published to the Kafka Topic

```
kafkacat -b dataplatform -t iot-v1
```

Next we will Integrate the message from Kafka with InfluxDB. For that we will be using StreamSets Data Collector as well. 

## Integrate Kafka with InfluxDB using StreamSets

Create a new pipeline and name it `IoT_Kafka_to_InfluxDB`. On the Pipeline canvas, add a `Kafka Multitopic Consumer` origin and use a temporary `Trash` for the destination. Later we will replace the Trash destination by the `InfluxDB` destination. 

Configure the **Kafka Multitopic Consumer** using the following settings

* **Broker URI**: `kafka-1:9092`
* **Topic List**: `iot-v1`
* **Data Format**: `JSON`


Add a **Expression Evaluator** and a **Field Type Converter** processor inbetween **Kafka Multitopic Consumer** and **Influx DB**. The pipeline should now look as shown below:

![Alt Image Text](./images/streamsets-pipeline-with-processors.png "MQTT UI Connect")

Run the pipeline already once in **Preview Mode** to see if data can be consumed from Kafka and to get StreamSets to know about the fields available. 

With the **Expression Evaluator** procesor we specify the name of the measurement, needed for the **InfluxDB** destination. Configure it using the following settings:

* **Output Field**: `/measurement`
* **Output Field**: `device`

![Alt Image Text](./images/streamsets-expression-evaluator.png "MQTT UI Connect")

With the **Field Type Converter** procesor we convert the string timestamp to a timestamp, needed for the **InfluxDB** destination. Configure it using the following settings:

* **Fields to Convert**: `/ts`
* **Convert to Type**: `DATETIME`
* **Data Format**: `Other...`
* **Other Data Format**: `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ`

The filled-out settings for the converter can be seen below

![Alt Image Text](./images/streamsets-preview.png "MQTT UI Connect")

Run the Pipeline once more in Preview mode to see if the date conversion workes as expected.

![Alt Image Text](./images/streamsets-preview-conversion.png "MQTT UI Connect")

For InfluxDB we first have to install the InfluxDB Library, as it is not pre-installed with the version of StreamSets which is installed on the Dataplatform. 

![Alt Image Text](./images/streamsets-package-manager.png "MQTT UI Connect")

In the **Type to search** box enter `Influx` and you should see the `InfluxDB 0.9+` library appear. The version might be different. 

Install it by selecting the item and clicking on the `+` on the top right corner. 

Streamsets will download the library and once finished will tell you to restart StreamSets. You can do that using the following docker command.

```
docker restart streamsets-1
```

Relogin to StreamSets once restarted and navigate back to the `IoT_Kafka_to_InfluxDB` pipeline. Remove the `Trash` destination and replace it by the `InfluxDB` destination, now available from the list of destinations. 

Configure the **InfluxDB** using the following settings

* **URL**: `http://influxdb:8086`
* **Username**: `admin`
* **Password**: `admin`
* **Database Name**: `iot`
* **Auto-create Database**: enabled
* **Record Mapping**: `Custom Mappings`
* **Measurement Field**: `/measurement`
* **Time Field**: `/ts`
* **Time Unit**: `MILLISECONDS`
* **Tag Fields**: `/uuid` and `/level`
* **Value Fields**: `/temp`

Now with all these configurations in place, we can run the pipeline by clicking on **Start**. 

The data is feed into the InfluxDB and avalable for visualization or analytics. 

## Visualize InfluxDB data using Chronograf

One tool for visualization is Chronograf, which is part of the so called [TICK Stack](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/) (TICK for **T**elegraf, **I**nfluxDB, **C**hronograf and **K**apacitor). 

In a browser window, navigate to <http://dataplatform:28152/> to open the Chronograf homepage.
